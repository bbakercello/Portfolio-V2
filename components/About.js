                <h6>I'm Ben</h6>
                <p>I'm a full-stack engineer who loves developing core infrastructures of technological products. I specialize in Javascript technologies (MERN stack - MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS) to build complete web applications. I develop elegant solutions using open source tools and proactively look for ways to make systems run efficiently. In my free time as a cellist and composer, I write electronic pieces of music using modular synthesizers and digital instruments.</p>
